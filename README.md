# Getting Started : Twitter Susi AI Bot Installation 
We will make a Susi messenger bot account on Twitter. This account will tweet back when it's name is mentioned in a tweet. Also, 1-on-1 auto chat will be inculcated to our account.

Make a new account, which you want to use as the bot account. You can make one from [here](https://www.twitter.com).

## Prerequisites
To create your account on -:
1. Twitter
2. Github
3. Heroku

## Setup your own Messenger Bot
1. Fork this repository.

2. Make a new app [here](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new), to know the access token and other properties for our application. These properties will help us communicate with Twitter.

4. Create a config variable by switching to settings page of your app.
   
   The name of your first config variable should be HEROKU_URL and its value is the url address of the heroku app created by you.

   The other config variables that need to be created will be these:
